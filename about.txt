skeletal wood race is my project and this game is protected under the gnu licence. 
the game comes from an shortfilmi had seen before and decided to develop a game from the animation. 
the game is all about a skeleton that is on wood and stuck in the middle of the sea after its pirate boat crashed in 
a stormy sea breeze. after the crash the only thing the skeleton found its self on was on a piece of wood with a treasure box remaining as the only piece of treasure. also remaining is a piece of string and a hook. using the hook and the string. the skeleton ties a piece of gold coin and throws it into the ocean which is accidentally cought by a big shark, an idea strucks the skeleton to use the shark so as to tow him  and the piece of wood towards the shore of the ocean.
the main aim of the game is to escape from colliding with some ocean features such as some rocks, trees, and even other  marine creatures and succesfully reach the shore.
the player has to control the skeleton from right to left using the left and right arrow keys and the space bar to duck  some of the tall ocean features.
